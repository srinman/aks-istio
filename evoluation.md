I want to write a blog post on how the application and networking evolved. It should be similar to how phil calcado described.  However,  we need to change the context.  we need to think about mainframe, earlier linux client, server architecture, distributed computing systems such as Hadoop, Spark, monolithic large linux or unix servers, cloud computing and kubernetes.  now we need to add Istio and help the reader to understand what and how Istio addresses some of the same challenges that existed decades ago but explain why it is suited for kuberenetes.  


Later in the blog, let's talk about some competing offerings. 

write about Istio and how eBPF based service meshes.  Explain where and how traffic is intercepted and routed between the two.
